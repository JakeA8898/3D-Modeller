# 3D-Modeller
This program was created as a project for a computer graphics class. It's main focus was to learn about and implement
ray picking. This is the concept of converting a point on the 2D plane and finding where the user clicked in the given
3D space. The project allowed users to place, position and change the size of varoious shaped in a 3d space.
The use of a "First person camera" was also implemented in its own module.
